# Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

Visualizing Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Tennessee using QGIS. 

With society's shift towards sustainable energy, electric vehicles are slowly but surely becoming the norm on the roadway. As someone who commutes long distances to my workplace, I was curious to see how many stations were in Tennessee. Would there be enough to warrant long distance travel or the peace of mind to know that I could recharge my vehicle as needed?

# After importing the CSV file 

I made sure to set the scale visibility for the layer as 1:500000000, so the points will plot at the correct location.

When I completed the map, I was surpised to see the amount of stations in Tennessee. If I were to make the shift to an electric vehicle, charging stations locations would be the least of my worries as there are plenty within a realistic distance from each other.
